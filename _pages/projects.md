For the hackathon, four research questions have been pre-defined (see below). It is also possible to contribute with your own research question or problem space.
However, do keep in mind that it should be within a Svalbard context. Furthermore, the data needs to be available at least during the hackathon and preferably afterwards as well. 
The registration form allows for ranking the problem spaces according to interest, as well as uploading additional research questions.

#### Glacier dynamic instabilities
##### Project created by Thomas V. Schuler, UiO    
Glacier evolution instabilities (surging) are governed predominantly by subglacial hydrology and basal friction. Due to these instabilities causing large mass redistribution in a short time, it is typically difficult to estimate glacier mass evolution with dominating instabilities as well as the contributions of these processes to the triggering of the instability. 4DM will be applied to estimate stress field changes at the glacier bed in the context of remotely sensed velocity fields, meltwater supply, surface and basal topography and other data.

#### Snow thickness spatio-temporal heterogeneity
##### Project created by Andreas Kääb, UiO  
What are the factors that contribute to variations in snow thickness? Factors such as runoff, evaporation, subsurface water, albedo, surface roughness and other climate forcing all play a role. 4DM will be used to separate primary controls on snow thickness variability using a combination of satellite and meteorological observations.

#### Rock glacier and permafrost dynamics
##### Project created by Benjamin Robson, UiB  
Rock glaciers and permafrost represent a large uncertainty with regards to the world’s storage of water ice and carbon with Svalbard being no exception. The water content of rock glaciers and permafrost is poorly constrained because it is difficult to determine from remotely sensed data. It is likely that the creep/deformation of rock glaciers and permafrost is in some way linked to the ratio between water ice and soil/rocks in rock glaciers and permafrost. 4DM will help to unpack the spatial and temporal variations of the flow of these complex processes.

#### Goal based mesh gridding for glacier mass balance modelling
##### Project created by Regine Hock, UiO   
4DM currently uses expert designed custom mesh grids for all applications. In many cases this is the right choice but for some applications it will be more effective and simpler to have a mesh that is automatically generated based on the relevant processes. Goal based mesh gridding is an attractive option as it converts the mesh generation problem into an optimization problem where mesh grid points are iteratively chosen in the context of data and the underlying statistical model. 4DM will be used to explore generating new mesh gridding techniques in the context of regional glacier mass balance modelling in Svalbard.
