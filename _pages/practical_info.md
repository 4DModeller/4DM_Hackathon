#### COVID
Covid outbreaks at conferences and workshops have shown how disruptive it can be, with many people being sick and stuck abroad. 
Depending on how the situation develops, we may require participants to adhere to certain COVID mitigation measures. 
These may include wearing masks and/or testing before and during the hackathon and will be mandatory for all participants.
In the case of government COVID measurements, including lockdowns or travel restrictions, appropriate action will be taken. This can include postponement of the hackathon or a virtual hackathon.
